Messaging

Messaging is a set of Python modules useful to deal with
"messages", as used in messaging, see for instance:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_messaging_system.

The modules include a transport independent message abstraction, a
versatile message generator and several message queues/spools to
locally store messages.

An Perl implementation of the same abstractions and queue algorithms
is available in CPAN:
